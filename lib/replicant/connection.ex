defmodule Replicant.Connection do
  @moduledoc """
  The `Postgrex.ReplicationConnection` that owns the replication slot and closes
  the exactly-once seam (spec §2/§4/§8). It:

    * replies to a reply-requested keepalive with the **last durably-checkpointed LSN**
      while any published transaction is in flight — never advancing the slot past
      un-persisted publication data (walex's fire-and-forget `wal_end+1` is the
      at-most-once bug this fixes). When IDLE (no open transaction and the checkpoint
      caught up), a `:state_mirror` sink advances the slot to the keepalive `wal_end`
      so a quiet-but-filtered publication stops pinning WAL (spec A1) — the intervening
      WAL carries nothing for the publication. An `:append_log` sink never performs
      that filtered-WAL advance: it acknowledges only its durable checkpoint and uses
      an ordinary published heartbeat transaction to release retained WAL;
    * decodes each XLogData payload behind Plan 1's value-free boundary and forwards
      the decoded message to `Replicant.AssemblerServer` — it never applies the sink,
      so it is always free to answer keepalives;
    * counts payload bytes and messages sent to, but not yet processed by, the
      assembler. WAL-position distance is not a queue-size estimate: unrelated
      WAL and segment switches can advance positions without publication data;
    * pauses socket delivery at `max_inflight_lag` payload bytes (default 64 MiB)
      or 512 queued messages and resumes below both half-watermarks. Cumulative,
      connection-scoped processing credits cannot advance the durable checkpoint;
    * advances the ack asynchronously on `{:sink_committed, L}` from the AssemblerServer;
    * on connect/reconnect detects an invalidated slot (`wal_status = 'lost'` or
      `conflicting` on PG16) and halts the pipeline fail-closed — never silently
      dropping and recreating the slot (spec §8 R-ISO).

  The connect chain is a `handle_result/2` state machine:
  `:identity_check` → `:recovery_check` → `:publication_check` →
  `:invalidation_check` →
  (`:create_slot` if absent) → `:streaming`.

  ## Backpressure and retained transactions

  This implementation requires Postgrex's pause/resume callback extension. Pausing keeps
  the connection and slot ownership alive. A five-second timer sends durable
  feedback because incoming keepalives are also paused; configure the server's
  `wal_sender_timeout` comfortably above that interval.

  The assembler separately budgets retained transaction/batch payloads, spilling
  streamed transactions or flushing committed batches. An oversized transaction
  that cannot spill halts with `:buffer_limit_exceeded`, not a pause that would
  prevent its own Commit from arriving. Neither budget is an exact RSS cap:
  decoded-term overhead, socket buffers, and a one-message overshoot are additional.
