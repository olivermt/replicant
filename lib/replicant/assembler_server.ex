  The serial process shell over the pure `Replicant.Assembler` (spec §4). Receives
  **decoded** pgoutput messages from `Replicant.Connection` (which decodes behind
  the value-free boundary and never applies the sink), assembles transactions, and
  applies the sink **synchronously** — blocking THIS process, off the Connection's
  keepalive path. On a durable sink commit (or a watermark skip) it messages the
  Connection so the ack advances asynchronously; on a fail-closed condition
  (destructive schema change, sink WRITE fault, an unidentifiable-relation row) it
  halts the whole pipeline permanently (spec §6/§9).

  It is a single serial `GenServer` (not a Task per transaction) so transactions
  apply strictly in commit order — the correctness baseline of synchronous
  per-transaction delivery.

  single-batch keyless read can complete before a late-arriving concurrent write discards its

  `epoch` is the window GENERATION the reader captured at `open_snapshot_window/2`. If a reconnect
