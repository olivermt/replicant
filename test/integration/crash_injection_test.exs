  # RISK #1 (finalized against the live stream): the plan's premise — "a crash after
  # sink-commit before ack re-delivers" — does NOT reach the SINK for a plain
  # `LedgerSink`. Two mechanisms suppress it, and neither is the client `start_lsn`:
  # (a) whether PG re-streams a transaction is governed by the slot's server-side
  # `confirmed_flush_lsn` (the client `START_REPLICATION ... <start_lsn>` value is a
  # clamped hint, never a lower bound PG honors literally); and (b) even when PG does
  # re-deliver, the Assembler's Commit-path pre-skip (`commit_lsn <= sink.checkpoint()`
  # → `{:skipped}`) drops it BEFORE the sink. So the sink's own idempotency dedup
  # (spec §6) is only reachable via the spec §14.15 checkpoint-read-fail-open path:
  # `FailOpenLedgerSink.checkpoint/0` reports `nil`, so after the kill-before-ack the
  # restart resumes from `0/0` (PG re-delivers txn 1) AND the Assembler pre-skip is
  # disabled (the re-delivery reaches the sink), whose DURABLE `_replicant_checkpoint`
  # watermark records it `skipped` and applies it zero more times.
  # The kill hook is `[:replicant, :sink, :committed]` — the real post-durable-commit,
  # pre-ack event: it fires from WITHIN the AssemblerServer AFTER the sink durably
  # commits and BEFORE that process sends `{:sink_committed, lsn}` to the Connection, so
  # the `Process.exit(conn, :kill)` (same sender) is enqueued ahead of the ack and wins.

  # ADVERSARIAL CRASH-INJECTION (spec §12.2 line 144: "kill the Connection ... MID-
  # TRANSACTION"). In pgoutput proto v1 PG streams a committed txn's frames
  # (Begin → row changes → Commit) as a burst; the AssemblerServer assembles them into
  # its open `txn` buffer and applies the sink SYNCHRONOUSLY at Commit — the transaction
  # is only DURABLY committed (checkpoint advanced) once `handle_transaction/1` returns.
  # A mid-transaction kill is a crash while a committed-in-PG transaction is IN-FLIGHT in
  # the consumer — assembled/being-applied but NOT yet durably committed. `:one_for_all`
  # discards that in-memory in-flight transaction, and on resume PG re-streams the WHOLE
  # transaction from the durable checkpoint — which sits BEFORE it (the prior control
  # txn's LSN) — so it is assembled and applied exactly once (loss=0, effect-dup=0).
  #
  # WHY A SANCTIONED TEST-ONLY HOOK, NOT `:sys.get_state`-POLLING: the task's primary
  # approach (poll the assembler's transient in-buffer `changes` and kill at
  # `0 < changes < N`) proved UNRELIABLE against the live stream — measured over 8 live
  # trials at N=2000 it caught the mid-buffer state only 2/8 times (6/8 MISS): the
  # AssemblerServer churns a large frame burst faster than a `:sys.get_state` poll can
  # observe it, and while it is applying a prior txn `:sys.get_state` times out entirely.
  # A racy catch is not a valid gate. So this uses the task's explicitly-sanctioned
  # fallback: a DETERMINISTIC test-only instrumentation hook (`PausingLedgerSink` +
  # `PauseGate`, test-support only, NO `lib/` change / telemetry) that blocks the
  # AssemblerServer at the sink boundary with the transaction fully ASSEMBLED but NOT
  # durably committed — the exact in-flight precondition a mid-transaction crash must
  # survive. The kill lands in that deterministic window; the injection-is-real evidence
  # is proven three ways at kill time: the sink signalled `{:sink_paused, lsn, N}` (the
  # whole txn assembled, N changes, about to apply), the durable checkpoint is still at
  # the CONTROL txn's LSN (the big txn NOT committed), and ZERO of the big txn's rows are
